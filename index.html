      <h2>
        Objective, Strategic, and Disciplined
      </h2>
      <p>
        Effective investment management services that focus on long-term results with risk management as our top priority.

        <h2>Assertive investment management</h2>
        <p>
          Sandpiper Capital was founded with the philosophy of bringing professional day-to-day
          portfolio management to households that have previously been excluded by the million
          dollar account minimums traditionally applied. Unlike transaction oriented financial
          services offered by banks, brokers, and insurance companies, we are fee-only Registered
          Financial Advisors, and are required by law to always act only in your best interest.
          Our mission is to dependably deliver effective portfolio management at low cost
          to non-profits and individuals who have made risk control a priority.
        </p>
        <h2>Investment models for both private and institutional clients</h2>
        <p>
          Proprietary tactical allocation models that actively manage risk and maximize potential
          returns on investment. Among the services we offer to both private and institutional
          investors include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Discretionary investment services</b> comprised
            of customized strategic asset allocation designed to suit your risk tolerance,
            investment objectives, and financial circumstances.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Sophisticated solutions</b> fueled by proprietary
            investment models and outside research, including Credit Suisse, JP Morgan and
            Morningstar.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>High quality, low cost annuities</b> from TIAA-CREF,
            the only directly sold AA+ annuity with expenses under 1.5% per year.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Value</b> coupled with the reliable execution
            and low transaction fee services of Schwab as custodian. Our fees are only 1%/year
            on accounts from $100,000 to $1 million.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Cooperation</b> with your existing financial
            relationships, lawyers, and accountants.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Interact directly with certified investment professionals</h2>
        <p>
          Among the credentials that financial professionals may hold, none are more highly
          regarded than, or as rigorously focused on investment knowledge, as the Chartered
          Financial Analyst designation.
          <br />
          <br />
          With over 30 years of experience, your portfolio manager, Thomas Lukic will work
          directly with you in designing, tailoring and managing your portfolio.
        </p>
        <h2>We share your goals</h2>
        <p>
          Our disciplined and thorough approach to long-term value investing are intrinsically tied
          and we enjoy the commonality of interests that makes our job so simple.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>To make your money grow predictably, safely and as quickly as the markets will allow</li>
          <li>To produce a dependable, growing stream of income</li>
          <li>To reduce your tax burden</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          At Sandpiper Capital, we believe the wisdom of the oft quoted maxim:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          "In the short run the market is a voting machine, in the long run it’s a weighing
          machine."
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          We are constantly weighing the value of the markets. We aspire to use the miscalculations
          that inevitably arise from decisions that are generated in environments of fear
          and greed to sell to the over-reaching and to buy from the fearful. Cost efficiency,
          risk avoidance and opportunistic, flexible strategies are the benchmarks of a successful
          investment program.
          <br />
          <br />
          Let the investment professionals at Sandpiper Capital use these tools to benefit
          you.
